            <h1>Band</h1>
            <p>I started Band when I was in 7th grade playing the French Horn and continued it until my senior year of high school. I met a lot of people that I'm still friends with today and had a lot of good times in band.  I would say band is a big part of who I am as a person </p>

            <h1>Computer Science</h1>
            <p>My journey into computer science started in 8th grade when my parents got me a rasberry Pi for christmas. I made my first program on that computer and I liked it so much I just wanted to pursue it. In 10th grade I took programming 1, 11th grade I took AP computer science (I got a 5), and in 12th grade I took programming 2 (and 3 technically) and independent study where I got get all the certificates that I have on the certificates page.</p>
