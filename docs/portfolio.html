            <h1>Rocket League Bot</h1>
            <p>I play a lot of Rocket League. And someone made a library called RLBot, which makes it easier for programmers and developers to make bots that play Rocket League. This exercise is a test where the bot goes straight for the ball.</p>

            <h1>Rocket League Flappybird</h1>
            <p>Before I made the rocket league bot, I was programming in python and playing around with something called pygame. I wanted to make a rocket league flappy bird and this is what came from the idea.</p>

            <h1>Background Intro</h1>
            <p>I had plans to make a game for a class project. I never really got around to making the game but I made this intro with the forest in the background. I thought it was pretty cool so I just decided to put it in here.</p>
