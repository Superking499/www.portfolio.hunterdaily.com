            <p>This certificate is my most important and hardest achievement. This cyber-certificate means that I know a lot of the basics of cybersecurity. In order to take this, I had to excel in a cyber competition, called Cyberstart America, so I could receive a one time pass to take the exam.</p>

            <p>I wanted to acquire a feel for how JavaScript worked; during high school I took the JavaScript Entry Level course just to see what it was like. JS is very handy for website-based applications.</p>

            <p>Python was the first programming language I used, and I think it's a very important one to learn, especially with AI nowadays. Most of my projects were made with Python. Speaking of projects, you should check them out!</p>

            <p>I had a really short window to pass this exam; this course went over terms and basic knowledge of computers and programming slang.</p>

            <p>This was my first ever programming certificate that I got; I got it while taking AP computer science. I got a 5 in AP computer science by the way, small flex.</p>

            <p>I got this in 12th grade while taking independent study. At the time, I was already pretty good at using Python, so I just took this test just to have the certificate.</p>

            <p>Originally I took the JSE test and got that certificate, then realized I didn't have this one, so much like the HS Py one, I took this test just to have it.</p>

            <p>Around the time that I started competing in the cyber competition mentioned in the GFACT certificate, I took this certificate test to brush up on some cybersecurity questions, I took this one a litte more seriously than the other Code HS certificates however because all the cyber stuff was still kind of foreign to me at the time.</p>
